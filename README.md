# PyBer-analysis

## Project Overview
This project was to use Jupyter Notebook to carry out analysis and visualization on Ride Share data based on city type (i.e Rural, Suburban, and Urban). By utilizing Matplotlib and Pandas, the summary of the data as it compares to city type is easily visible, as compared to a table with numerical data. For the first analysis, ride share information was calculated and box and whisker plots were outputted, to get an overall sense of the number of riders, drivers, and fares per city type. For the challenge analysis, all city data was analyzed to get total riders, drivers
