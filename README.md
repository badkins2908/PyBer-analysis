# PyBer-analysis

## Project Overview
This project was to use Jupyter Notebook to carry out analysis and visualization on Ride Share data based on city type (i.e Rural, Suburban, and Urban). By utilizing Matplotlib and Pandas, the summary of the data as it compares to city type is easily visible, as compared to a table with numerical data. For the first analysis, ride share information was calculated and box and whisker plots were outputted, to get an overall sense of the number of riders, drivers, and fares per city type. For the challenge analysis, all city data was analyzed to get total riders, drivers

Data Summary

From the above information in the Total Fare by City Type and Data Summary, you can see that the total sum of fares for urban ride shares from Janauary to April 2019 was nearly three times the total sum of fares for rural ride shares. This means urban ride shares are far more popular than rural ride shares, which makes sense due to density in population and number of available drivers. We can also see the fare cost for riders is far more expensive in rural locations, than in urban. And the total fare received by the driver is higher than in urban cities. This could be due to supply and demand, due to low supply in rural locations the price is increased which in turn decreases demand. For the urban fares, with supply being high this drives prices down which increases demand due to prices being low.

We can also see, from the Total Fare by City Type, that in the mid-March to late-March, there seems to be a spike in fares across all city types. This could be that Spring Break for most schools is during this time, so more people are traveling, going to events, or traveling around town. In addition, there is a slight decrease in fares after April for Urban and Rural, where as Suburban increases.

## Summary
My recommendations would be as follows:
1. Around mid to late March, there seems to be an increase in total fares which means there is an increase in the number of ride shares during this time. This could be a good time to slightly increase fares and make more money, due to more people traveling via ride share.
2. During times where one city type is low, in terms of total fares, and another city type is increasing -- send extra drivers from the decreasing city type to the increasing city type. This will possibly bring in more money, with demand increases and there being more supply from the additional drivers in the area.
3. Increase the number of drivers in the rural city type, this will help drive prices down a bit which will increase demand and in turn increase ride share in that area.
